# **Calculator**

### This project was used to refamiliarize myself, as well as create a project for the first time, with **Maven**. Maven is a java tool to create an manage larger projects and uses the **Project Object Model** (pom) file to list dependencies and settings about the project (very similar to the package.json file from react)

### Along with getting better at using **Maven**, I used this project to refamilarize myself with the coding flow of **Test Driven Development** (TDD) using JUnit in which I have not used in a few years.

### When in college, we never were able to create projects using maven, we had to use a premade skeleton. I used this project to get an understanding for creating the Calculator project using Maven as well as inspect the pom.xml file so I can use maven in the future to create larger scale java projects.
